## Build With Teensy 3.0

The SlideChop code is built with a [Teensy 3.0](http://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy3.html)
hardware device to emulate a mouse. The Teensy 3.0 code and device
should be cross-platform compatible, and require no driver installation.
Your computer should instantly recognize the device as just another
generic HID.

When you slap the chopper once, it will left click the mouse. When
you slap-and-hold the chopper for more than 1 second, it will
right click the mouse.
